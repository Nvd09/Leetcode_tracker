# Leetcode Tracker

## Overview
Leetcode Tracker is a project designed to help users efficiently prepare for coding interviews and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. By implementing **spaced repetition**, the application ensures that users revisit problems at optimal intervals for better retention. The platform supports user authentication to track individual progress and sends **daily notifications** to remind users about their topic of the day.

Currently, the **frontend** of the project is complete, while the **backend** development is pending.

## Features
1. **Spaced Repetition**: Suggests previously solved problems based on their revisit interval.
2. **User Authentication**: Allows users to sign up and log in to save their progress.
3. **Daily Notifications**: Notifies users about their assigned topic or problem for the day.
4. **Progress Tracking**: (Planned) Tracks completed problems, progress over time, and strengths/weaknesses.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS
- **State Management**: Context API/Redux (as applicable)

### Backend (Planned):
